### Applications & Software

Install and removal of packages via terminal:  
 - Ordinary users must prepend with `sudo`
    - Followed by entering user password
    - This gives certain `root` user permissions without being in `root` account 

#### Package manager
- Package repo with vast collection of apps available to install
- Debian, Ubuntu, Mint install | uninstall commands
    - `dpkg` (DEB Packages)
    - `apt-get`
    - `apt`
    - Searching repos
        - `apt-cache search package_name`
            - `apt-cache` used to search for pkgs and list info about available pkgs
    - `apt search package_name`
- Full download and install string example
    - `sudo apt-get install package_name`  
    - `sudo apt install package_name`

#### Network administration
- Network configuration
    - Set of programs running on router
        - Responsible for setting up and checking network availability

#### Programming languages
- Programs
    - Single file or complex system of files
        - OS treats these files as instruction sequence
        - Performed by processor and other devices
    - Begin as text file known as *source code* 
        - Uses various human readable languages that describe program actions

- Compiled languages
    - Source code converted to binary file
        - Computer executes binary file
    - *Compiler* program responsible for conversion
        - Compiled binary specific to kind of processor
    - Not computer readable and executable 
            - Processor can not directly execute these human readable languages
   
- Interpreted languages
    - Program does not need to be compiled
    - *Interpreter* reads source code and executes every time program is run
    - Pro
        - Development is easier and faster
    - Con
        - Programs tend to be slower than compiled programs 
    - Aka *scripting languages*
