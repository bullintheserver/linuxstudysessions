ICT Skills and Working in Linux  
Weight: 2  

### Desktop environments 
- Modularity
    - Different parts of the Linux system are developed by different projects and developers
    - Several options for desktop enviros 
    - Can install multiple enviros and pick the most useful for the user
- Two major desktop enviros in Linux world
    - *Gnome*
        - Streamlined, clean applications
        - Based on GTK toolkit
            - Written in C
        - Uses *Gnome Terminal* emulator
    - *KDE*
        - Larger selection of apps
        - Highly customizable configuration
        - Based on Qt library
            - Written in C++
        - Uses *Konsole* terminal emulator
- Many terminals available 
    - *Xterm* another choice

### Presentations and projects
- LibreOffice Impress
    - part of LibreOffice suite
    - Open source replacement for Microsoft Office
    - Can open PTT and PPTX Powerpoint native files
    - Use ODP Impress format 
        - Part of Open Document Format
            - International standard file format 
- Beamer
    - LaTeX document class for making slides and presentations 
        - LaTeX is a markup typesetting system
        - De facto standard for scientific documents
        - Handles complex math symbols well
- Reveal.js
    - NPM package (NPM is default NodeJS package manager)
    - Create presentations by using the web
    - Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
    - Interactive presentations 
    - Adapts well on any resolution and screen size
- Other Microsoft Project replacements
    - GanttProject
    - ProjectLibre

### Industry uses of Linux
- Estimated 68% of web servers are Unix
    - Largest portion of those are Linux
    - Allows for lower cost and greater scalability
    - Many Linux systems run in cloud as IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
    - Pay as you go format
    - Process known as *Virtualization*
    - Shares resources of large server/host machine
        - Pieced into smaller virtual machines (VMs)/operating systems
        - VMs run as guests on host machine and access is granted
        - *Hypervisor* 
            - Software responsible for segregation and management of resources for guest OSs
- Open source hypervisors
    - Xen
        - Oldest
    - KVM
        - Development sponsored by RedHat
        - Most prominent
    - VirtualBox
        - Belongs to Oracle since its acquisition of Sun Microsystems
        - Usually used by end users due to ease of use
- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
    - Users access a platform where they build, deploy, run their app 
    - Eases burden of system admin and OS updates
    - Heroku common PaaS example
        - Program code runs without taking care of containers or VMs
- SaaS (Software as a Service)
    - Pay for software without worrying about underlying system
    - i.e. Dropbox, Salesforce
    - Often accessed through web browser
- OpenStack
    - Collection of open source software that can make use of different hypervisors and other tools in order to offer a complete IaaS cloud enviro on premises

### Privacy issues when using the internet
- Cookie tracking
    - Websites save small files on computer to store and retrieve information
    - Meant for ease of use UX
    - Can be exploited 
    - Many services require cookies to be enabled
        - Websites can "break" if cookies are disabled 
    - Cookie managers are useful tools to help manage and control cookie usage and persistance on your computer
- DNT aka Do Not Track
    - Does not mean your browsing is hidden
    - DNT is simply a way to ask websites to not track you
        - Websites don't have to comply 
    - Uses header flag of HTTP request (DNT: 1) 
    - Visit allaboutdnt.com for more info
- Private windows
    - aka private mode, incognito, or anonymous 
    - Firefox: `ctrl`+`shift`+`p`
    - Chrome: `ctrl`+`shift`+`n`
    - Is not actually private but opens new window which will auto delete all session data upon exit
        - No personal data, history, passwords, or cookies are stored after session ends 
    - Is not private to the network, ISP, or someone standing behind you
- Choosing the right password
    - Do not use the same password more than once 
    - Do not re-use same password/email combos 
    - Do use a password manager 
        - Manager stores all passwords and usernames 
        - Can generate strong new passwords for you
        - *KeePass* and *Bitwarden* strong password managers

### Encryption
- *Transport Layer Security (TLS)*
    - Protocol that uses cryptography to secure network connections
    - Successor of *Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)*
        - Depreciated due to security flaws
    - Current version 1.3
    - Provides privacy and authenticity
        - Uses symmetric and asymmetric public/private keys to establish connections
    - The lock icon in the browser address bar signifies secure connection
    - HTTPS protocol
        - HTTP over TLS
        - Makes sensitive data transfer possible
            - Such as payment transactions and banking
- GnuPG
    - GNU Privacy Guard
        - Open source implementation of OpenPGP
    - Can be used to sign, encrypt, and decrypt 
    - Works with public-key cryptography
    - Widely available 
- Disk encryption
    - Two basic methods
        - Stacked
            - Implemented on top of existing filesystem
            - Files and directories encrypted before being stored
        - Block
            - Below filesystem layer
            - Makes sure everything that is written to a block device is encrypted
            - If observed offline, will look like random data
    - *dm-crypt*
        - De facto standard for block encryption for Linux systems 
        - Native in the kernel
        - Can be used with *LUKS (Linus Unified Key Setup)* extension
            - Specification that implements a platform-independent standard for use with various tools
    - *EncFS*
        - Stackable 
        - Easiest way to secure data on Linux
        - Does not require root privileges
        - Can work on existing filesystem without modifications 
    - *Veracrypt*
        - If access to data on various platforms needed
        - Successor of Truecrypt 
        - Allows creation of encrypted media and files
        - Cross-platform: Linux, MacOS, Windows
