# 1.3
Open Source Software and Licensing  
Weight: 1  

## The four essential freedoms
- Freedom 0
    - Freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- Freedom 1
    - Freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
    - Access to source code is a precondition.
- Freedom 2
    - Freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
- Freedom 3
    - Freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
    - Gives whole community chance to benefit from changes.
    - Access to source code is a precondition.

## FOSS & FLOSS
- FOSS
    - Free & open source software
- FLOSS
    - Free/libre & open source software
- Proprietary
    - For profit, controlled, limited 

## Copyleft
- *Free Software Foundation* created licenses
    - *GNU General Public License* (GPL)
        - One of the most important license for free software
        - Used for the Linux kernel
    - *GNU Lesser General Public License* (LGPL)
        - Combination free software with modifications made to code where source code for mods do not have to be released to public
    - *GNU Affero General Public License* (AGPL)
        - Covers selling access to hosted software
    - *GNU Free documentation License* (FDL)
        - Extends freedom principles to software documentation
    - Also makes recommendations for or against:
        - Third party license
        - Affiliated projects

- *Copyleft*
    - FSF term meant to contrast principle of restrictive copyright
    - Transfers the liberal principles of a software license as unrestrictedly as possible to future variants of the software in order to prevent subsequent restrictions. 
    - Critics call copyleft "viral" since it's transmitted to subsequent versions
    - LGPL is a concession to be able to connect free software with "non-free" components
    - *Dual licensing*
        - Licensing under multiple licenses
        - e.g. a free license and a proprietary license

## Open source & licenses 
- *Open Source Initiative* (OSI)
    - Has standardized procedure for checking OS software license compliance
    - Has more than 80 recognized OS licenses on the OSI website
    - *Berkeley Software Distribution*
        - Contradictory to copyleft
        - "OSI approved," especially the BSD licenses group
        - Variant of Unix OS originally developed at UC Berkeley
        - Gave rise to
            - NetBSD
            - FreeBSD
            - OpenBSD
        - Underlying licenses "permissive" 
            - Do not have aim of establishing terms of use of modified variants
            - Maximum freedom should help software decide how to edit
            - Developers have control over open or closed source
        - *2-Clause BSD License*, aka *Simplified BSD License*, or *FreeBSD License*
            - Consists of a standardized liability clause and the following:
                - Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

## Business models in open source
