Open Source Software and Licensing
Weight: 1  

### The four essential freedoms
- Freedom 0
    - Freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- Freedom 1
    - Freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
    - Access to source code is a precondition.
- Freedom 2
    - Freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
- Freedom 3
    - Freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
    - Gives whole community chance to benefit from changes.
    - Access to source code is a precondition.

### FOSS & FLOSS
- FOSS
    - Free & open source software
- FLOSS
    - Free/libre & open source software
- Proprietary
    - For profit, controlled, limited 

### Copyleft
- *Free Software Foundation* created licenses
    - *GNU General Public License* (GPL)
        - One of the most important license for free software
        - Used for the Linux kernel
    - *GNU Lesser General Public License* (LGPL)
        - Combination free software with modifications made to code where source code for mods do not have to be released to public
    - *GNU Affero General Public License* (AGPL)
        - Covers selling access to hosted software
    - *GNU Free documentation License* (FDL)
        - Extends freedom principles to software documentation
    - Also makes recommendations for or against:
        - Third party license
        - Affiliated projects

- *Copyleft*
    - FSF term meant to contrast principle of restrictive copyright
    - Transfers the liberal principles of a software license as unrestrictedly as possible to future variants of the software in order to prevent subsequent restrictions. 
    - Critics call copyleft "viral" since it's transmitted to subsequent versions
    - LGPL is a concession to be able to connect free software with "non-free" components
    - *Dual licensing*
        - Licensing under multiple licenses
        - e.g. a free license and a proprietary license

### Open source & licenses 
- *Open Source Initiative* (OSI)
    - Has standardized procedure for checking OS software license compliance
    - Has more than 80 recognized OS licenses on the OSI website
    - *Berkeley Software Distribution*
        - Contradictory to copyleft
        - "OSI approved," especially the BSD licenses group
        - Variant of Unix OS originally developed at UC Berkeley
        - Gave rise to
            - NetBSD
            - FreeBSD
            - OpenBSD
        - Underlying licenses "permissive" 
            - Do not have aim of establishing terms of use of modified variants
            - Maximum freedom should help software decide how to edit
            - Developers have control over open or closed source
        - *2-Clause BSD License*, aka *Simplified BSD License*, or *FreeBSD License*
            - Consists of a standardized liability clause and the following:
                - Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

### Industry uses of Linux
- Estimated 68% of web servers are Unix
    - Largest portion of those are Linux
    - Allows for lower cost and greater scalability
    - Many Linux systems run in cloud as IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
    - Pay as you go format
    - Process known as *Virtualization*
    - Shares resources of large server/host machine
        - Pieced into smaller virtual machines (VMs)/operating systems
        - VMs run as guests on host machine and access is granted
        - *Hypervisor* 
            - Software responsible for segregation and management of resources for guest OSs
- Open source hypervisors
    - Xen
        - Oldest
    - KVM
        - Development sponsored by RedHat
        - Most prominent
    - VirtualBox
        - Belongs to Oracle since its acquisition of Sun Microsystems
        - Usually used by end users due to ease of use
- PaaS (Platform as a Service)
    - Users access a platform where they build, deploy, run their app 
    - Eases burden of system admin and OS updates
    - Heroku common PaaS example
        - Program code runs without taking care of containers or VMs
- SaaS (Software as a Service)
    - Pay for software without worrying about underlying system
    - i.e. Dropbox, Salesforce
    - Often accessed through web browser
- OpenStack
    - Collection of open source software that can make use of different hypervisors and other tools in order to offer a complete IaaS cloud enviro on premises

### Privacy issues when using the internet
- Cookie tracking
    - Websites save small files on computer to store and retrieve information
    - Meant for ease of use UX
    - Can be exploited 
    - Many services require cookies to be enabled
        - Websites can "break" if cookies are disabled 
    - Cookie managers are useful tools to help manage and control cookie usage and persistance on your computer
- DNT aka Do Not Track
    - Does not mean your browsing is hidden
    - DNT is simply a way to ask websites to not track you
        - Websites don't have to comply 
    - Uses header flag of HTTP request (DNT: 1) 
    - Visit allaboutdnt.com for more info
- Private windows
    - aka private mode, incognito, or anonymous 
    - Firefox: `ctrl`+`shift`+`p`
    - Chrome: `ctrl`+`shift`+`n`
    - Is not actually private but opens new window which will auto delete all session data upon exit
        - No personal data, history, passwords, or cookies are stored after session ends 
    - Is not private to the network, ISP, or someone standing behind you
- Choosing the right password
    - Do not use the same password more than once 
    - Do not re-use same password/email combos 
    - Do use a password manager 
        - Manager stores all passwords and usernames 
        - Can generate strong new passwords for you
        - *KeePass* and *Bitwarden* strong password managers

### Encryption
- *Transport Layer Security (TLS)*
    - Protocol that uses cryptography to secure network connections
    - Successor of *Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)*
        - Depreciated due to security flaws
    - Current version 1.3
    - Provides privacy and authenticity
        - Uses symmetric and asymmetric public/private keys to establish connections
    - The lock icon in the browser address bar signifies secure connection
    - HTTPS protocol
        - HTTP over TLS
        - Makes sensitive data transfer possible
            - Such as payment transactions and banking
- GnuPG
    - GNU Privacy Guard
        - Open source implementation of OpenPGP
    - Can be used to sign, encrypt, and decrypt 
    - Works with public-key cryptography
    - Widely available 
- Disk encryption
    - Two basic methods
        - Stacked
            - Implemented on top of existing filesystem
            - Files and directories encrypted before being stored
        - Block
            - Below filesystem layer
            - Makes sure everything that is written to a block device is encrypted
            - If observed offline, will look like random data
    - *dm-crypt*
        - De facto standard for block encryption for Linux systems 
        - Native in the kernel
        - Can be used with *LUKS (Linus Unified Key Setup)* extension
            - Specification that implements a platform-independent standard for use with various tools
    - *EncFS*
        - Stackable 
        - Easiest way to secure data on Linux
        - Does not require root privileges
        - Can work on existing filesystem without modifications 
    - *Veracrypt*
        - If access to data on various platforms needed
        - Successor of Truecrypt 
        - Allows creation of encrypted media and files
        - Cross-platform: Linux, MacOS, Windows
