## 2.3
Using Directories and Listing Files  
Weight: 2  

### Lesson 1

#### Files, Directories, Naming

- Files
    - Contain data
        - Human readable text
        - Executable programs
        - Binary data
- Directories
    - Create organization within filesystem
    - Can contain
        - Files
        - Subdirectories
            - Has a *parent* / *child* relationship
- Naming
    - Case sensitive
    - Files and directories can contain
        - Upper case
        - Lower case
        - Numbers
        - Spaces
        - Special characters
        - Suffixes
            - .txt, .pdf, .jpg, etc.
            - Have no special meaning in Linux
            - There for human understanding

#### Navigating the Filesystem

- `pwd`
    - *Print working directory*
    - Can also be seen in command prompt before `$` or `#`
    - Always prints absolute path
        - Every step of path printed 
        - Always begins with a `/`
- `/`
    - Denotes relationships
    - Directory hierarchy read from left to right
    - Directories on right are subdirectories
    - Directories on left are parent directories
- `ls` 
    - Lists contents of current directory
    - Does not see parent or child directories by default
        - Must use modifier to see beyond current directory
- `cd` 
    - Changes directory
    - Can use absolute or relative path
        - Use `ls` to relative paths for current location
    - `cd ..` up a level
    - `cd /` root directory
    - `cd ~` home directory
    - `cd -` previous directory
    - `cd [path] && ls`
        - Goes to `path` and lists contents simultaneously
    - Can use relative paths 
        - Only has meaning in relation to current location


### Lesson 2

#### Home Directories
- Changes in root affect all users
- Changes in root require admin perms
- Home
    - Users separated into dedicated compartments 
    - Root responsible for utilities and maintenance 
- Terminal command prompt 
    - `user@hostname ~ $`
        - The `~` represents *home directory*
    - Users will always begin a new session in their home directory
    - `cd ~` or `cd` to jump to user `home`
    - Specify `home` of other users by placing username after tilde
        - `$ ls ~michael`
        - Must have permission

#### Hidden Files and Directories
- `ls -a`
    - Lists all, incl. hidden, files and directories
    - Hidden files and directories will always begin with a period `.`
        - `.` represents *current location*
        - `..` represents *parent directory*
    - By default, user's home includes many hidden files
        - Used to set user-specific config settings 
        - Should only be modified by experienced user
- `ls -l` 
    - Alias `ll`
    - `-l` creates a long list
    - Files and dirs. occupy one line
    - Additional info on each file and dir. is displayed
        - Permissions
        - Number of links to the file
        - Ownership
        - Size in bytes
        - Timestamp of last modification
        - Name

```
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff    3606 Jan 13  2017 report2018.txt
```

#### Additional `ls` Options

- `ls -lh` 
    - Combines *long list* with *human readable* 
- `ls -d */` 
    - `-d` option lists directories but not contents
    - `*/` shows only subdirectories and no files
- `ls -lt` 
    - Combines *long list* with sort by *modification time*
    - Most recent at top, oldest at bottom
- `ls -lrt` 
    - Same as above but with `r` *reverse* sort
- `ls -lX` 
    - Combines *long list* with sort by *file eXtension* 
- `ls -S` 
    - Sorts by *size*
    - Large to small 
    - Subdirectories not included in sort
- `ls -R` 
    - Displays *recursive* list
    - "Unfolds" or runs the "ls" command in each subdirectory
