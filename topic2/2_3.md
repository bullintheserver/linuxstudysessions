## 2.3
Using Directories and Listing Files  
Weight: 2  

### Lesson 1

#### Files, Directories, Naming

- Files
    - Contain data
        - Human readable text
        - Executable programs
        - Binary data
- Directories
    - Create organization within filesystem
    - Can contain
        - Files
        - Subdirectories
            - Has a *parent* / *child* relationship
- Naming
    - Case sensitive
    - Files and directories can contain
        - Upper case
        - Lower case
        - Numbers
        - Spaces
        - Special characters
        - Suffixes
            - .txt, .pdf, .jpg, etc.
            - Have no special meaning in Linux
            - There for human understanding

#### Navigating the Filesystem

- `pwd`
    - *Print working directory*
    - Can also be seen in command prompt before `$` or `#`
    - Always prints absolute path
        - Every step of path printed 
        - Always begins with a `/`
- `/`
    - Denotes relationships
    - Directory hierarchy read from left to right
    - Directories on right are subdirectories
    - Directories on left are parent directories
- `ls` 
    - Lists contents of current directory
    - Does not see parent or child directories by default
        - Must use modifier to see beyond current directory
- `cd` 
    - Changes directory
    - Can use absolute or relative path
        - Use `ls` to relative paths for current location
    - `cd ..` up a level
    - `cd /` root directory
    - `cd ~` home directory
    - `cd -` previous directory
    - `cd [path] && ls`
        - Goes to `path` and lists contents simultaneously
    - Can use relative paths 
        - Only has meaning in relation to current location


### Lesson 2

#### Home Directories
- Changes in root affect all users
- Changes in root require admin perms
- Home
    - Users separated into dedicated compartments 
    - Root responsible for utilities and maintenance 
- Terminal command prompt 
    - `user@hostname ~ $`
        - The `~` represents *home directory*
    - Users will always begin a new session in their home directory
    - `cd ~` or `cd` to jump to user `home`
    - Specify `home` of other users by placing username after tilde
        - `$ ls ~michael`
        - Must have permission

#### Hidden Files and Directories
- `ls -a`
    - Lists all, incl. hidden, files and directories
    - Hidden files and directories will always begin with a period `.`
        - `.` represents *current location*
        - `..` represents *parent directory*
    - By default, user's home includes many hidden files
        - Used to set user-specific config settings 
        - Should only be modified by experienced user
- `ls -l` 
    - Alias `ll`
    - `-l` creates a long list
    - Files and dirs. occupy one line
    - Additional info on each file and dir. is displayed
        - Permissions
        - Number of links to the file
        - Ownership
        - Size in bytes
        - Timestamp of last modification
        - Name

```
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff    3606 Jan 13  2017 report2018.txt
```

#### Additional `ls` Options

- `ls -lh` 
    - Combines *long list* with *human readable* 
- `ls -d */` 
    - `-d` option lists directories but not contents
    - `*/` shows only subdirectories and no files
- `ls -lt` 
    - Combines *long list* with sort by *modification time*
    - Most recent at top, oldest at bottom
- `ls -lrt` 
    - Same as above but with `r` *reverse* sort
- `ls -lX` 
    - Combines *long list* with sort by *file eXtension* 
- `ls -S` 
    - Sorts by *size*
    - Large to small 
    - Subdirectories not included in sort
- `ls -R` 
    - Displays *recursive* list
    - "Unfolds" or runs the "ls" command in each subdirectory 

Creating, Moving, and Deleting Files

### Creating 

- Case sensitivity
    - Linux is case sensitive
    - Windows is not case sensitive 
- Directories
    - File used to organize files
    - Directories can hold other directories
- Files
    - Collection of data
        - Has a name
        - Has attributes
- `mkdir` 
    - Creates directories
    - Add `-p` or `--parents` option to create subdirectories simultaneously
- `find` 
    - Used to search for files and directories
    - Without options, returns listing of all files, directories, sub-dirs. of current directory
- `touch`
    - Followed by name will create empty file 
    - If ran on existing file, mod timestamp will update
- `cat` aka *concatenate*
    - Used to view contents of a file
    - Can merge files
        - `cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt`
- `echo`
    - Displays text on the command line
    - If ran with an `>` *output redirect* it will write the text to a file
    - `>` will overwrite if file name already exists
    - `>>` appends text to the end of existing file

### Moving
- `mv`
    - Last argument is destination dir
    - Multiple files can be specified
    - ex: `mv file1 file2 dir1`
    - Can be used to rename
        - `mv dir1 dir2`

### Deleting
- `rm` can delete files and directories
    - Use `rm -r` to recursively remove nested directories
        - USE WITH CAUTION
        - `rm -ri` to prompt for confirmation before deletion
- `rmdir` will delete empty directories

### Copying
- `cp` copies files and directories
    - Use last argument as destination of copies
    - If last argument is a file, it will be overwritten 
    - Use `-r` for copying directories
        - Will also copy contents of directory

### Globbing
- Pattern matching language 
- `*` 
    - Matches any number of any characters
        - Includes no characters
- `?`
    - Matches any one character
- `[]`
    - Matches a class of characters 
        - `[:classname:]`
        - e.g. `ls file[[:digit:]]`
    - Both `[]` and `{}` will work with `ls` to display ranges
        - `ls file[1-3]` or `ls file{1..3}` 
    - Only `{}` will work with `touch` to write a range of individual files
        - `touch file{1..3}`
- Pattern matching characters can be mixed
    - `ls file[1-3]*`
- Must use `\` to escape these special meanings
