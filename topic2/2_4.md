## 2.4
Creating, Moving, and Deleting Files  
Weight: 2 

### Creating 

- Case sensitivity
    - Linux is case sensitive
    - Windows is not case sensitive 
- Directories
    - File used to organize files
    - Directories can hold other directories
- Files
    - Collection of data
        - Has a name
        - Has attributes
- `mkdir` 
    - Creates directories
    - Add `-p` or `--parents` option to create subdirectories simultaneously
- `find` 
    - Used to search for files and directories
    - Without options, returns listing of all files, directories, sub-dirs. of current directory
- `touch`
    - Followed by name will create empty file 
    - If ran on existing file, mod timestamp will update
- `cat` aka *concatenate*
    - Used to view contents of a file
    - Can merge files
        - `cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt`
- `echo`
    - Displays text on the command line
    - If ran with an `>` *output redirect* it will write the text to a file
    - `>` will overwrite if file name already exists
    - `>>` appends text to the end of existing file

### Moving
- `mv`
    - Last argument is destination dir
    - Multiple files can be specified
    - ex: `mv file1 file2 dir1`
    - Can be used to rename
        - `mv dir1 dir2`

### Deleting
- `rm` can delete files and directories
    - Use `rm -r` to recursively remove nested directories
        - USE WITH CAUTION
        - `rm -ri` to prompt for confirmation before deletion
- `rmdir` will delete empty directories

### Copying
- `cp` copies files and directories
    - Use last argument as destination of copies
    - If last argument is a file, it will be overwritten 
    - Use `-r` for copying directories
        - Will also copy contents of directory

### Globbing
- Pattern matching language 
- `*` 
    - Matches any number of any characters
        - Includes no characters
- `?`
    - Matches any one character
- `[]`
    - Matches a class of characters 
        - `[:classname:]`
        - e.g. `ls file[[:digit:]]`
    - Both `[]` and `{}` will work with `ls` to display ranges
        - `ls file[1-3]` or `ls file{1..3}` 
    - Only `{}` will work with `touch` to write a range of individual files
        - `touch file{1..3}`
- Pattern matching characters can be mixed
    - `ls file[1-3]*`
- Must use `\` to escape these special meanings
