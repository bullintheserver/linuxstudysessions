### Lesson 1

#### Shell
- Text mode program that reads user input and interprets it as commands to the system
- A few common shells
    - Bourne-again shell (Bash)
    - C shell (csh, tcsh, enhanced csh)
    - Korn shell (ksh)
    - Z shell (zsh)
- Bash
    - Most common on Linux
- Default prompt structure
    - `username@hostname currentdirectory _shell_type`
- Ubuntu, Debian GNU/Linux
    - Regular user
        - `carol@mycomputer:~$`
    - Superuser
        - `root@mycomputer:~#`
- CentOS, RHL
    - Regular user
        - `[dave@mycomputer~]$`
    - Superuser
        - `[root@mycomputer~]#`
- Components of structure
    - `username`
        - Name of user that runs the shell
    - `hostname`
        - Name of host on which shell runs
        - There is also a command `hostname`
            - Shows or sets system host name
    - `current_directory`
        - Directory shell is currently in
        - A `~` means shell is in current user's home directory
    - `shell_type` 
        - `$` indicates shell is run by regular user
        - `#` indicates shell is run by superuser `root`

#### Command line structure
- Basic structure
    - `command [option(s)...] [argument(s)...]
    - Example: `$ ls -l /home`
        - Command: `ls` is program that will be run
        - Options: `-l` is the switch that modifies behavior
        - Argument: `/home` is the additional data required, such as path or filename
    - `--help`
        - Use after command to display short overview of command

#### Command behavior types
- Internal
    - Part of shell itself
    - Main purpose is executing tasks inside the shell
- External
    - Reside in individual files
    - Usually binary programs or scripts
    - Uses the `PATH` variable to search for executable file
    - Users can create their own
- `type`
    - Follow with command to show type

```
$ type echo
echo is a shell builtin

$ type man
man is /usr/bin/man
```

#### Quoting
- Three types of quotes in Bash
    - Double quotes
    - Single quotes
    - Escape characters
- Double quotes
    - Text in between quote marks are regular characters
    - Special characters lose meaning
        - Except
            - `$`
            - `\`
            - `` ` ``
    - Although you could create filenames with spaces using double quotes, best practice is to use `_` or `.` as spacers instead

```
$ touch "new file"
vs
$ touch new_file
```

- Single quotes
    - No exceptions 
    - Revoke any special meaning
- Escape characters
    - Removes special meanings of characters
    - Placed before special character

```
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo I am $USER
I am tom
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo "I am $USER"
I am tom
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo 'I am $USER'
I am $USER
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo I am \$USER
I am $USER
```

### Lesson 2

#### Variables
- Pieces of storage for data
    - Such as text or numbers
    - Value can be accessed at a later time
    - Access by set name, even if content changes
    - Common tool in most programming languages
- Two types in most Linux shells
    - Local variables
        - Available to current shell process only
        - Not inherited by sub processes
    - Environment variables
        - Available in specific shell sessions and in sub processes spawned from that shell session
        - Can pass configuration data to commands which are run
        - Majority of enviro variables are in capital letters
            - e.g. `PATH`, `DATE`, `USER`
        - For example, a set of default enviro variables provide info about user's home directory 
        - Sometimes complete set of all enviro variables is referred to as the *environment*
        - `env` command displays all enviro variables 
- Variables are not persistent 
    - When shell closes, variables and contents are lost
    - Most shells provide config files that contain variables which are set on shell launch
    - If variable should be permanent, it must be added to config file

#### Manipulating variables 
- Set up local variable using `=`
- Access value using `$`
    - Tells Bash to expand the variable and use its value
- Remove variable using `unset` without `$` as it is now an argument
    - If `$` is used it expands the variable to it's value instead of affecting the variable name 

```
$ greeting=hello
$ echo $greeting
hello
$ unset greeting
```

- Use `export` to make variable available to subprocesses and make it an enviro variable

```
$ export greeting=hello
```

- Use environment variables in front of commands
    - Example
        - `TZ` holds timezone
        - `date` command displays date and time information

```
$ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date
Sun July 4 12:12:12 PM PDT 2025
```

- `Path` 
    - Stores list of directories, separated by a colon, that contain executable programs eligible as commands from the Linux shell
    - Use `:` to append new directory to the variable
        - In example, `$PATH` is resolved as the current value, and the `:new_directory` is added on to the resolution using the setting function `=` 
    - Use `PATH` variable with caution
    - `which` can be used to locate executable files
    - Order of elements in `PATH` defines lookup order

```
$ echo $PATH
/home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
$ PATH=$PATH:new_directory
$ echo $PATH
/home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:new_directory
$ which nano
/usr/bin/nano
```

- Command substitution
    - ``` var_name=`command [OPTION] path_here` ```

```
$ nr_files=`wc -l /etc/passwd`
$ echo $nr_files
100 /etc/passwd
```
