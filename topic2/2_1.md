# Topic 2
Finding Your Way on a Linux System

## 2.1
Command Line Basics  
Weight: 3 

### Lesson 1

#### Shell
- Text mode program that reads user input and interprets it as commands to the system
- A few common shells
    - Bourne-again shell (Bash)
    - C shell (csh, tcsh, enhanced csh)
    - Korn shell (ksh)
    - Z shell (zsh)
- Bash
    - Most common on Linux
- Default prompt structure
    - `username@hostname currentdirectory _shell_type`
- Ubuntu, Debian GNU/Linux
    - Regular user
        - `carol@mycomputer:~$`
    - Superuser
        - `root@mycomputer:~#`
- CentOS, RHL
    - Regular user
        - `[dave@mycomputer~]$`
    - Superuser
        - `[root@mycomputer~]#`
- Components of structure
    - `username`
        - Name of user that runs the shell
    - `hostname`
        - Name of host on which shell runs
        - There is also a command `hostname`
            - Shows or sets system host name
    - `current_directory`
        - Directory shell is currently in
        - A `~` means shell is in current user's home directory
    - `shell_type` 
        - `$` indicates shell is run by regular user
        - `#` indicates shell is run by superuser `root`

#### Command line structure
- Basic structure
    - `command [option(s)...] [argument(s)...]
    - Example: `$ ls -l /home`
        - Command: `ls` is program that will be run
        - Options: `-l` is the switch that modifies behavior
        - Argument: `/home` is the additional data required, such as path or filename
    - `--help`
        - Use after command to display short overview of command

#### Command behavior types
- Internal
    - Part of shell itself
    - Main purpose is executing tasks inside the shell
- External
    - Reside in individual files
    - Usually binary programs or scripts
    - Uses the `PATH` variable to search for executable file
    - Users can create their own
- `type`
    - Follow with command to show type

```
$ type echo
echo is a shell builtin

$ type man
man is /usr/bin/man
```

#### Quoting
- Three types of quotes in Bash
    - Double quotes
    - Single quotes
    - Escape characters
- Double quotes
    - Text in between quote marks are regular characters
    - Special characters lose meaning
        - Except
            - `$`
            - `\`
            - `` ` ``
    - Although you could create filenames with spaces using double quotes, best practice is to use `_` or `.` as spacers instead

```
$ touch "new file"
vs
$ touch new_file
```

- Single quotes
    - No exceptions 
    - Revoke any special meaning
- Escape characters
    - Removes special meanings of characters
    - Placed before special character

```
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo I am $USER
I am tom
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo "I am $USER"
I am tom
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo 'I am $USER'
I am $USER
tom@mycomputer:~$ echo I am \$USER
I am $USER
```

### Lesson 2

[Back to Topic 3 | 3.3 | Lesson 1 | Variables](https://github.com/bullintheserver/linuxstudysessions/blob/main/topic3.md#variables)

#### Variables
- Pieces of storage for data
    - Such as text or numbers
    - Value can be accessed at a later time
    - Access by set name, even if content changes
    - Common tool in most programming languages
- Two types in most Linux shells
    - Local variables
        - Available to current shell process only
        - Not inherited by sub processes
    - Environment variables
        - Available in specific shell sessions and in sub processes spawned from that shell session
        - Can pass configuration data to commands which are run
        - Majority of enviro variables are in capital letters
            - e.g. `PATH`, `DATE`, `USER`
        - For example, a set of default enviro variables provide info about user's home directory 
        - Sometimes complete set of all enviro variables is referred to as the *environment*
        - `env` command displays all enviro variables 
- Variables are not persistent 
    - When shell closes, variables and contents are lost
    - Most shells provide config files that contain variables which are set on shell launch
    - If variable should be permanent, it must be added to config file

#### Manipulating variables 
- Set up local variable using `=`
- Access value using `$`
    - Tells Bash to expand the variable and use its value
- Remove variable using `unset` without `$` as it is now an argument
    - If `$` is used it expands the variable to it's value instead of affecting the variable name 

```
$ greeting=hello
$ echo $greeting
hello
$ unset greeting
```

- Use `export` to make variable available to subprocesses and make it an enviro variable

```
$ export greeting=hello
```

- Use environment variables in front of commands
    - Example
        - `TZ` holds timezone
        - `date` command displays date and time information

```
$ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date
Sun July 4 12:12:12 PM PDT 2025
```

- `Path` 
    - Stores list of directories, separated by a colon, that contain executable programs eligible as commands from the Linux shell
    - Use `:` to append new directory to the variable
        - In example, `$PATH` is resolved as the current value, and the `:new_directory` is added on to the resolution using the setting function `=` 
    - Use `PATH` variable with caution
    - `which` can be used to locate executable files
    - Order of elements in `PATH` defines lookup order

```
$ echo $PATH
/home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
$ PATH=$PATH:new_directory
$ echo $PATH
/home/user/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:new_directory
$ which nano
/usr/bin/nano
```

- Command substitution
    - ``` var_name=`command [OPTION] path_here` ```

```
$ nr_files=`wc -l /etc/passwd`
$ echo $nr_files
100 /etc/passwd
```

Creating, Moving, and Deleting Files  
Weight: 2 

### Creating 

- Case sensitivity
    - Linux is case sensitive
    - Windows is not case sensitive 
- Directories
    - File used to organize files
    - Directories can hold other directories
- Files
    - Collection of data
        - Has a name
        - Has attributes
- `mkdir` 
    - Creates directories
    - Add `-p` or `--parents` option to create subdirectories simultaneously
- `find` 
    - Used to search for files and directories
    - Without options, returns listing of all files, directories, sub-dirs. of current directory
- `touch`
    - Followed by name will create empty file 
    - If ran on existing file, mod timestamp will update
- `cat` aka *concatenate*
    - Used to view contents of a file
    - Can merge files
        - `cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt`
- `echo`
    - Displays text on the command line
    - If ran with an `>` *output redirect* it will write the text to a file
    - `>` will overwrite if file name already exists
    - `>>` appends text to the end of existing file

### Moving
- `mv`
    - Last argument is destination dir
    - Multiple files can be specified
    - ex: `mv file1 file2 dir1`
    - Can be used to rename
        - `mv dir1 dir2`

### Deleting
- `rm` can delete files and directories
    - Use `rm -r` to recursively remove nested directories
        - USE WITH CAUTION
        - `rm -ri` to prompt for confirmation before deletion
- `rmdir` will delete empty directories

### Copying
- `cp` copies files and directories
    - Use last argument as destination of copies
    - If last argument is a file, it will be overwritten 
    - Use `-r` for copying directories
        - Will also copy contents of directory

### Globbing
- Pattern matching language 
- `*` 
    - Matches any number of any characters
        - Includes no characters
- `?`
    - Matches any one character
- `[]`
    - Matches a class of characters 
        - `[:classname:]`
        - e.g. `ls file[[:digit:]]`
    - Both `[]` and `{}` will work with `ls` to display ranges
        - `ls file[1-3]` or `ls file{1..3}` 
    - Only `{}` will work with `touch` to write a range of individual files
        - `touch file{1..3}`
- Pattern matching characters can be mixed
    - `ls file[1-3]*`
- Must use `\` to escape these special meanings

| classname | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [:alnum:] | Letters and numbers |
| [:alpha:] | Upper or lowercase letters |
| [:blank:] | Spaces and tabs |
| [:cntrl:] | Control characters, e.g. backspace, bell, NAK, escape |
| [:digit:] | Numerals (0123456789) |
| [:graph:] | Graphic characters (all characters except ctrl and the space character) |
| [:lower:] | Lowercase letters (a-z) |
| [:print:] | Printable characters (alnum, punct, and the space character) |
| [:punct:] | Punctuation characters, i.e. !, &, " |
| [:space:] | Whitespace characters, e.g. tabs, spaces, newlines |
| [:upper:] | Uppercase letters (A-Z) |
| [:xdigit:] | Hexadecimal numerals (usually 0123456789abcdefABCDEF) |
