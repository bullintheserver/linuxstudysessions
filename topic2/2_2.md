# Topic 2
Finding Your Way on a Linux System

## 2.2
Using the Command Line to Get Help  
Weight: 2

### Getting Help on the Command Line
- `/usr/share/doc/`
    - Stores most documentation of commands used by system 
    - Contains directory for most packages installed on system
        - Usually name of package and possibly version
        - Include a `README` OR `readme.txt` containing basic package documentation
        - Folder can also contain other documentation such as:
            - Changelog
                - Includes history of program in detail
            - Example configuration files
- `--help`
    - Follows command_name
    - Brief instructions on command usage
    - Good first try for learning parameters
- `man`
    - Manual page
    - Command to be explained added as argument
        - `man ls`
    - `q` quits manual page
    - Use `/` in front of word to search forward
    - Use `?` in front of word to search backward
    - Use `n` to jump to next match
- Each man page divided into max of 11 sections
    - Some sections are optional

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| NAME | Command name and brief description |
| SYNOPSIS | Description of the command's syntax |
| DESCRIPTION | Description of the effects of the command |
| OPTIONS | Available options |
| ARGUMENTS | Available arguments |
| FILES | Auxiliary files |
| EXAMPLES | A sample of the command line |
| SEE ALSO | Cross-references to the related topics |
| DIAGNOSTICS | Warning and Error messages |
| COPYRIGHT | Author(s) of the command |
| BUGS | Any known limitations of the command |

- There are 8 categories of man pages
    - Each man page belongs to exactly one category
    - Multiple categories can contain man pages with same name
    - You can specify category number
        - `man 1 passwd`, `man 5 passwd`


| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Executable programs or shell commands |
| 2 | System calls (functions provided by the kernel) |
| 3 | Library calls (functions within program libraries) |
| 4 | Special files (usually found in /dev) |
| 5 | File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd |
| 6 | Games |
| 7 | Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7), man-pages(7) |
| 8 | System administration commands (usually only for root) |
| 9 | Kernel routines [Non standard] |

- Info pages
    - More detailed than `man` pages
    - Formatted in hypertext 
    - Command to be explained added as argument
        - `info mkdir`
    - Read from file structured as nodes within a tree
    - Contains hyperlinks 
    - Use `?` for navigation instructions
- `locate`
    - Searches within a database
    - Outputs ever matching string
    - Supports wildcard and regular expressions use
    - Behaves as it pattern is surrounded by asterisks by default
        - Allows for substrings instead of exact filename
        - Recent files might not be found
            - Update database using `sudo updatedb`
- `find`
    - Searches directory tree recursively
    - Does not maintain a database like `locate`
    - Supports wildcards and regular expressions
    - Requires at least a path
        - `.` Searches current directory
        - `~` Searches user's home directory
    - Expressions can be added to filter 
        - e.g. `-name` 

```
$ find ~ -name thesis.pdf
/home/carol/Downloads/thesis.pdf
```

Creating, Moving, and Deleting Files  
Weight: 2 

### Creating 

- Case sensitivity
    - Linux is case sensitive
    - Windows is not case sensitive 
- Directories
    - File used to organize files
    - Directories can hold other directories
- Files
    - Collection of data
        - Has a name
        - Has attributes
- `mkdir` 
    - Creates directories
    - Add `-p` or `--parents` option to create subdirectories simultaneously
- `find` 
    - Used to search for files and directories
    - Without options, returns listing of all files, directories, sub-dirs. of current directory
- `touch`
    - Followed by name will create empty file 
    - If ran on existing file, mod timestamp will update
- `cat` aka *concatenate*
    - Used to view contents of a file
    - Can merge files
        - `cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt`
- `echo`
    - Displays text on the command line
    - If ran with an `>` *output redirect* it will write the text to a file
    - `>` will overwrite if file name already exists
    - `>>` appends text to the end of existing file

### Moving
- `mv`
    - Last argument is destination dir
    - Multiple files can be specified
    - ex: `mv file1 file2 dir1`
    - Can be used to rename
        - `mv dir1 dir2`

### Deleting
- `rm` can delete files and directories
    - Use `rm -r` to recursively remove nested directories
        - USE WITH CAUTION
        - `rm -ri` to prompt for confirmation before deletion
- `rmdir` will delete empty directories

### Copying
- `cp` copies files and directories
    - Use last argument as destination of copies
    - If last argument is a file, it will be overwritten 
    - Use `-r` for copying directories
        - Will also copy contents of directory

### Globbing
- Pattern matching language 
- `*` 
    - Matches any number of any characters
        - Includes no characters
- `?`
    - Matches any one character
- `[]`
    - Matches a class of characters 
        - `[:classname:]`
        - e.g. `ls file[[:digit:]]`
    - Both `[]` and `{}` will work with `ls` to display ranges
        - `ls file[1-3]` or `ls file{1..3}` 
    - Only `{}` will work with `touch` to write a range of individual files
        - `touch file{1..3}`
- Pattern matching characters can be mixed
    - `ls file[1-3]*`
- Must use `\` to escape these special meanings

| classname | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [:alnum:] | Letters and numbers |
| [:alpha:] | Upper or lowercase letters |
| [:blank:] | Spaces and tabs |
| [:cntrl:] | Control characters, e.g. backspace, bell, NAK, escape |

| [:lower:] | Lowercase letters (a-z) |

| [:space:] | Whitespace characters, e.g. tabs, spaces, newlines |

| [:xdigit:] | Hexadecimal numerals (usually 0123456789abcdefABCDEF) |
