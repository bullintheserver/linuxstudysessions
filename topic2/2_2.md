- `--help`
    - Follows command_name
    - Brief instructions on command usage
    - Good first try for learning parameters
- `man`
    - Manual page
    - Command to be explained added as argument
        - `man ls`
    - `q` quits manual page
    - Use `/` in front of word to search forward
    - Use `?` in front of word to search backward
