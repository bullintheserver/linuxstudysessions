## 3.2
Searching and Extracting Data from Files  
Weight: 3 

### Lesson 1

#### I/O Redirection 
- *stdin*
    - Channel 0
    - Standard input
    - Considered to be keyboard
- *stdout*
    - Channel 1
    - Standard output
    - Considered screen
- *stderr*
    - Channel 2
    - Default redirects error outputs
        - For command
        - For programs 
        - Input/output can be redirected 
- Redirection of command components 
    - Transmit information to command
    - Redirect output to file
    - Redirect from or to command via text file
- `>`
    - Redirect output to file
    - Follow will name of file
    - Will create non-existent file
    - Will overwrite existing file
- `>>`
    - Appends and returns carriage to next line
    - Will not overwrite file
    - Can create new file
    - Follow with desired file name
- `2>`
    - Redirects just error messages
    - Follow with desired file name
    - useful for creating error logs
- `2>>`
    - Append error message
    - Same rules as `>>`
- `/dev/null`
    - Use with caution
    - Is a *bit bucket*
    - Unwanted output can be piped here
    - Data sent to `/dev/null` is discarded 
    - Provides no data when read from
- `<` 
    - Input data to a command from file
    - `cat < filename.txt`
    - Used with commands that don't accept file arguments
        - e.g. `tr -d "s" < filename.txt`
            - Deletes the letter "s" out of filename.txt 
- `<<`
    - *Here document*
    - Represents block of code/text which can be redirected to the command or interactive program
    - Different types of scripting languages can take input directly from CLI without using text files
    - Will present you with lines you can return in without submission
    - Submit by entering name given after `<<` followed by return carriage 
    - Can be combined with other redirection
        - e.g. `cat << inthehat > inthehat.txt`
- `&>`, `&>>`
    - Combines channel 1 and channel 2 outputs 
    - Use same rules as `>` and `>>` but with the channels combined

#### Command Line Pipes 
- `|`
    - *Pipes*
    - Link commands directly
    - Avoids saving output then running separate command
    - First command output becomes second command input
    - Can be used in succession to continue filtering 
- `head`
    - Displays first 10 lines of text by default
    - `-n` specifies number of lines if desired
- `tail`
    - Displays last 10 lines of text by default
    - `-n` specifies number of lines if desired
- `more`
    - Allows for paging through files
- `less`
    - Allows for paging through files 
    - Can scroll forward and backward
    - More robust and faster than `more`
    - *Less is more*
        - Used to remember `less` has more functionality 
- `wc`
    - Counts lines, words, bytes
    - `-w` counts only words
    - `-l` counts only lines
    - `-c` counts only bytes
- `cut`
    - Prints selected parts of lines from FILE to standard output
    - `-f` specifies the field 
    - `-d` specifies how fields are to be defined
        - Delimiter
        - e.g. `/` will define fields as between each `/`S
- `tr`
    - Translates or deletes characters
    - `-d` specifies deletion
    - `-s` *squeeze repeats* 
        - Replace sequence of repeated characters with single occurrence 
- `sort`
    - Write sorted concatenation of FILE to standard output
    - `-f` ignores case
    - `-r` reverses output 

### Lesson 2

#### grep
- `grep`
    - *global regular expression print*
    - Searches within file for specified pattern
    - Outputs line containing pattern and highlights in red
- `-i`
    - Search case-insensitive 
- `-r` 
    - Recursive search through subdirectories 
- `-c` 
    - Counts number of matches 
- `-v` 
    - Inverts search
    - Prints lines that do not match
- `-E`
    - Turns on extended regular expressions
    - Needed by advanced meta-characters
        - e.g. `|`, `+`, `?`
    - Can also use `egrep`
        - Depreciated in some systems

#### Regular Expressions
- Extracts data by constructing patterns
- Commonly used within scripts or when programming
    - Often with high level languages: Perl, Python
- !!! Every character counts !!!
    - Pattern is written to match specific string
- Most patterns use normal ASCII symbols
    - Letters
    - Digits
    - Punctuation
    - Symbols
- Can also use Unicode

| Meta-Characters | Function |
|-----------------|----------|
| `.` | Match any single character (except newline) |
| `[abcABC]` | Match any one character within the brackets |
| `[^abcABC]` | Match any one character except the ones in the brackets |
| `[a-z]` | Match any character in the range |
| `[^a-z]` | Match any character except the ones in the range |
| `either\|or` | Find either of the listed strings |
| `^` | Start of a line |
| `$` | End of a line |
| `*` | Zero or more of the preceding pattern |
| `+` | One or more of the preceding pattern |
| `?` | Zero or one of the preceding pattern |

```
$ grep "^a" text.txt
ant
anvil
arachnid 

$ grep "a$" text.txt
santa
flora
fauna

$ grep -E "ab.+" text.txt
abcde
about
cab ride
```
