## 3.1
Archiving Files on the Command Line  
Weight: 2 

### Introduction
- Compression
    - Reduces space consumption
    - Reduces data transfer size on networks
- Lossless
    - Can be uncompressed back to original
- Lossy
    - Cannot be recovered
    - Often used when:
        - Quality loss is imperceptible for humans
        - Space is more valuable than quality
        - Quality is irrelevant to context
- Linux compression tools
    - Lossless
        - `bzip2` (`.bz`)
        - `gzip` (`.gz`, `.z`, `.tgz` for `tar`)
        - `xz` (`.xz`)
    - Each tool uses a different algorithm
        - Won't work interchangeably
    - Incl. special versions of common tools
        - `cat`, `grep`, `diff`, `less`, `more`
        - `gzip` tools prefixed with `z`
            - e.g. `zcat`, `zgrep`, etc.
        - `bzip2` prefixed with `bz`
        - `xz` prefixed with `xz`
- Archiving tools
    - Used to bundle files/dirs. into single file
    - Common uses:
        - Backups
        - Bundled source code
        - Data retention 
    - Compression capabilities of archivers range from:
        - Optional
        - Default
        - Not included

### tar
- `tar`
    - Stands for *tape archive*
    - Most common Linux archiver
    - On it's own manages but does not compress
    - Files known as *tar balls*
- `-c` option
    - Creates new archive file
- `-f` option
    - Specifies the next input is name of file
    - Can include path
    - Without path, will place in current location
- Final arguments
    - After location and name
    - Paths to files/dirs to be included
- `-t` option
    - Lists contents of an archive
- `-v`
    - Verbose mode
    - Displays operations and names of files
- `-x`
    - Extracts files from archive
    - Can be used to extract single file from within archive
        - Use path and filename
- `-u`
    - Updater, appends does not overwrite 
    - Add files to existing uncompressed `tar` archive
    - Will cause error if attempted with compressed `tar`
- Compression calls as options
    - `bzip2`
        - `-j`
        - e.g. `tar -cjf file.tar.bz2 bigfile1`
    - `xz`
        - `-J` 
        - e.g. `tar -cJf file.tar.xz bigfile1`
    - `gzip`
        - `-z`
        - e.g. `tar -czf file.tar.gz bigfile1`
    - Remember to always add correct file extensions

### zip
- Windows compatibility 
    - `tar` applications uncommon in Windows
    - Use ZIP files for Windows interaction 
- ZIP files
    - Is an archive file
    - Similar to compressed `tar` file
    - `zip` & `unzip` will work on Linux CLI 
    - `-r` recursion needed to include directory contents
    - `-f` freshen
    - `#` 
        - Regulates speed of compression
        - `-1` fastest (least compression)
        - `-9` slowest (most compressed)
        - `-6` default level
