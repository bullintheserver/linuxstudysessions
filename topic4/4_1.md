# **4.1**
Choosing an Operating System  
Weight: 1  

## **Choosing a Linux Distribution**
### **Operating Systems**
- Linux-based OSs
    - Enterprise
    - Consumer grade
- UNIX
- MacOS
- Windows-based OSs
    - Windows Servers
    - Windows Desktops

### **Kernel and Distros**
- Kernel
    - At the core of every distro
    - Manages system resources
    - Facilitates hardware <> software communication

**! Check your version and kernel with `uname -r`!**

- Key functions of the kernel incl:
    - Process management
    - Memory management 
    - Device management
    - File system management
    - System calls and interrupts
- Distributions aka "distros"
    - Packaged version of Linux OS
    - Includes
        - Installer
        - Linux kernel
        - Selection of software apps 
        - Libraries
        - Desktop environment. such as:
            - Gnome
            - KDE
        - Utilities
        - Additional tools for functionality
        - Version of linux kernel
    - Each distro tailored for:
        - Different use cases
        - User preferences
        - Hardware configurations

### **Types of Distros**

#### **Enterprise Grade Linux Distros**
- Designed for large org/enterprise hardware
- Meets higher requirements for stability
- Distros tend to incl. older reliable releases of kernel/software
- Distros port important updates, security fixes back to stable versions
- May lack support for most recent consumer hardware

Includes:  
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- CentOS
    - *Community ENTerprise*
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
- Debian GNU/Linux
- Ubuntu LTS
    - Long term support versions suited for enterprise

#### **Consumer Grade Linux Distros**
- Meant for SOHO, hobbyist users
- Likely to be using latest hardware
- Will need and have latest drivers 
- Will not meet needs of large orgs/enterprise
- Usually the latest kernel 
    - May be under-tested, that's alright

Includes:  
- Fedora
- Ubuntu non-LTS
- openSUSE

#### **Experimental/Hacker Linux Distributions**
- Live on cutting edge of technology
- Contain recent versions
    - Even if they have bugs or untested features
- Use a rolling release model
    - Allows for update delivery at any time
- Use by advanced users

Includes:  
- Arch
- Gentoo

#### **Conclusion**
- Check https://distrowatch.com/ for more distro options
- Enterprise hardware
    - Can use both enterprise or consumer distros
- Consumer hardware
    - Must use consumer distros

### **Linux Support Lifecycle**
- Longest support cycle: enterprise
    - e.g. RHEL has 10 years support
- Consumer support
    - Often only community support on forums
    - Software updates often only 3 releases
- LTS: Long term support
    - Some distros have LTS versions
    - These versions suitable for enterprise
    - e.g. Ubuntu supplies 5 years support for LTS
        - Ubuntu distros use date-based version numbers
        - Formatted YY.MM
        - e.g. 19.04 was released April 2019

### **Linux as Your Desktop**
- More challenging in enterprise
    - Desktop support focuses on commercial OS offerings
    - Large investments into software solutions tie users into specific desktop OSs
    - Some companies have their own distros
        - Amazon Linux 2 for example
            - Used for AWS Cloud but also internally for servers and desktops
- Easier in SOHO set-ups
    - Removes need for licensing
    - Access to full gamut of FLOSS
    - Abundance of desktop environments
        - Most common:
            - Gnome
            - KDE

### **Using Linux on Servers**
- Linux servers common in enterprise sector
- Maintained by Linux specialized engineers
- Users often ignorant of server they connect to
- Client apps will not differ between Linux and other OSs in the backend
- OS further masked as more apps are virtualized or containerized within local and remote clouds

### **Linux in the Cloud**
- Exercise your skills by deploying a Linux distro on a public cloud

## **Non Linux Operating Systems**

### **Unix**
- Pre Linux
- Used to be sold along with hardware
- Several commercial versions still available on the market
    - AIX
    - HP-UX
- Linux highly inspired by Unix
- BSD (*Berkeley Software Distribution*) family of OSs directly based on Unix
    - Such as:
        - FreeBSD
        - NetBSD
        - OpenBSD
- Other popular OSs include:
    - Irix
    - Solaris

### **MacOS**
- Previously OS X
- Dates back to 2001
- Based heavily on BSD Unix
- Makes use of Bash CLI shell
- `uname` works in MacOS as in Linux
    - `-s` returns OS name
    - `-r` returns kernel version number

```bash
$ uname -s
Darwin
```

### **Microsoft Windows**
- Majority of desktops and laptops will be Windows based
- Proprietary, is not free 
- OS license is included when purchasing the hardware
- Wide support throughout hardware and software vendors
- Many open source applications available for Windows
- As a server platform:
    - Allows choice between GUI and CLI-only versions
- Most of the time the GUI of older serers will be loaded but not used
- Active Directory Domain Controller type applications will be accessed remotely and not at the server
