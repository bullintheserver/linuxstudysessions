## 4.2
Understanding Computer Hardware  
Weight: 2  

### Power Supplies
- Computer system hardware requires:  
    - Specific voltages
    - Tight tolerances
    - Desktops
        - Usually use wall outlets
    - Servers
        - Usually connect to multiple sources
    - Cooling components
        - To counteract generated heat

- Power supplies:  
    - Normalize available sources of power

- Standardized voltage:  
    - allow for world wide functionality of hardware components

### Motherboard
- Normalized interconnections  
    - Uses standardized connectors and form factors
    - Provides support for electrical needs of connectors

- Configurations  
    - Many different form factors
    - Some allow for customization 
    - Supports different processors and memory systems

- Programming  
    - Stored in nonvolatile memory
        - Known as firmware
    - Original firmware was BIOS
        - *Basic Input/Output System*
        - Although out of date, the term stuck
            - BIOS refers to both BIOS and UEFI
    - Next generation was EFI
        - EFI standardized 
        - Became UEFI
            - *Unified Extensible Firmware Interface*
    - Virtualization
        - Must be enabled through BIOS/UEFI settings
        - Few other configurations modified by most general users

### Memory
- Holds data and code of current running apps  
    - Known as RAM
        - Random Access Memory
    - Also referenced by physical packaging
        - DIMM
        - SIMM
        - DDR
- Packaged in modules
    - Plug into motherboard
    - Range from 2GB to 64GB
    - 4GB minimum system memory users should consider
    - 16GB good for general workstations
    - Higher recommended for heavy graphics/audio applications
    - Servers often require 128-256GB
- Swap space
    - Used if no memory is available
    - Idle applications moved here from system memory
- Dedicated memory
    - Users can elect to install dedicated memory for heavy applications
- Information gathering
    - `free -m`
        - Retrieves memory availability output in megabytes

### Processors
