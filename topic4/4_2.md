## 4.2
Understanding Computer Hardware  
Weight: 2  

### Power Supplies
Computer system hardware requires:
    - Specific voltages
    - Tight tolerances
    - Desktops
        - Usually use wall outlets
    - Servers
        - Usually connect to multiple sources
    - Cooling components
        - To counteract generated heat

Power supplies:
    - Normalize available sources of power

Standardized voltage:
    - allow for world wide functionality of hardware components

### Motherboard
Normalized interconnections
    - Uses standardized connectors and form factors
    - Provides support for electrical needs of connectors

Configurations
    - Many different form factors
    - Some allow for customization 
    - Supports different processors and memory systems

Programming
    - Stored in nonvolatile memory
        - Known as firmware
    - Original firmware was BIOS
        - *Basic Input/Output System*
    - Next generation was EFI
        - EFI standardized 
        - Became UEFI
            - *Unified Extensible Firmware Interface*
