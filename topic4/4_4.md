## Basic Network Concepts
- Links
    - Physical connections between two devices allowing for information exchange
        - Copper cables
        - Optical fibers
        - Radio waves
        - Lasers
- Interfaces
    - Physical edge point on device (visible or internal) that connects links to device
    - Can have more than one
- Link layer networks
    - Group of devices directly connected via links
- Routers
    - For communication beyond immediate network
    - Act like bridges that allow data to travel between them
- Packets
    - Small units of data transmitted over a network
        - Main building blocks of all communications over a network
        - Can contain the data for files, webpages, video calls, YouTube videos, Spotify streaming, video-game streaming, online chats, and anything else you can access online
    - Purpose
        - Break down large data into manageable chunks for efficient transmission over networks
        - May come with a packet number when part of a larger group for assembling packets in correct order on receiving end
    - Structure
        - Header
            - Contains information on source, destination, addresses, packet number, protocol, etc.
        - Payload
            - The actual data
                - File
                - Website
                - Email contents
                - Etc.
        - Trailer
            - Error checking
- Layered networking
    - Conceptual divisions of network communication functions
    - Each layer represents a specific set of related tasks and protocols
    - Networks work together to enable data transmission across networks
    - Most common layer models are
            -         - OSI mode
        - TCP/IP model
    - While you don't need to know either models in depth for this certification, here is a small introduction to three relevant layer concepts for the purposes of this lesson
        - Data link or simply link layer
            - Divides packets into frames
                - Frames are mainly for local addressing and distribution and are similar to a packet but not the same
            - Assembles frames into packets
            - Deals with physical addressing (MAC addressing)
            - Manages access
            - Detects errors 
        - Network layer
            - Routes packets between logically separated networks
            - Deals with logical addressing (IP addressing)
            - Forwards packets
        - Application layer 
            - Provides network services directly to end users and apps
            - Provides email services 
            - Allows remote host login

## Link Layer Networking
- Link Layer Address
    - Identifies devices on the same link
    - In Ethernet networks, this address is called a Media Access Control (MAC) address
- MAC Address Characteristics
    - Consists of 48 bits
    - Not globally unique
            - Used only within the same local network (link
    - Cannot route packets to devices on other links
- Packet Handling
    - The recipient checks if the destination MAC address matches its own
    - If it matches, the packet is processed
    - If not, the packet is dropped
- Broadcast Packets
    - Exception to the above rule
    - Sent to all devices in the local network and always accepted
- Network interface
    - Hardware or software component connecting a device to the network
    - Provides physical connection to network
    - Can be a simulated connection point
    - Assigned a unique identifier (MAC address for ethernet)
    - Allows for the sending and receiving of data
    - E.g.
        - Ethernet card
        - WiFi adapter
- `ip link show`
    - Displays details of all network interfaces available on a system
    - Shows active aka "up" or inactive aka "down" status
    - Output
        - Interface Index
            - A number representing the network interface
        - Interface Name
            - Name of the interface
                - `eth0` for ethernet 0
                - `wlan0` for wireless local area network (lan)
                - `lo` for loopback
        - MAC Address
            - Physical address associated with the interface
        - MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
            - Size limit for packets that can be transmitted
        - Flags
            - Indicates the interface status and capabilities 
                - (e.g., UP, BROADCAST, MULTICAST)
        - Detailed information
            - Queue length, link type, etc.

## Networking Concepts and Keywords (brief summary)
- IPv4 Addresses
    - 32-bit addresses that indicate the source and destination of data packets
    - Theoretical maximum
        - 4.29 billion addresses
    - Many addresses reserved for special purposes (broadcast, multicast, private use)
    - Human-readable format
        - four numbers (0-255) separated by dots
- IPv4 Subnets
    - IP addresses are split into network and host portions
    - Network portion
        - Routes packets to a specific network
    - Host portion
        - Identifies specific devices on the network
    - Subnet Mask
        - Defines the split between network and host portions
    - CIDR Notation
        - Expresses the number of bits set in the subnet mask (e.g., `192.168.0.1/24`)
- Private IPv4 Addresses
    - Reserved subnets for private use
        - `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`
    - Not routable on the public internet; used for internal communication.
    - Most home networks use private addresses mapped to a single public IP via NAT
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
    - Maps multiple internal addresses to a single external IP for internet communication
    - Masquerading
        - A form of NAT where internal devices are hidden behind one public IP
    - Does not provide security; a firewall is still required for protection

## IPv4 Address Configuration
- Two main methods
  - Manual Assignment
    - The user assigns the IP address manually to a network interface
  - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    - Automatically assigns IP addresses using a server
- DHCP server
  - Assigns IP addresses to devices on the network
  - Can also provide other network information
    - DNS server IPs, default gateway, etc.
  - Common in most networks
    - Especially home and enterprise environments
    - DHCP is usually enabled by default
      - Most devices receive an IP address automatically when connected to a network

- `ip addr add` (Manually Assign an IPv4 Address)
  - Purpose
    - Assign a specific IPv4 address to a network interface manually
  - `IP_address`
    - The IPv4 address you want to assign
  - `subnet_mask` The subnet mask in CIDR notation 
    - (e.g., `/24` for a 255.255.255.0 mask)
  - `interface_name`
    - The name of the network interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`)
  - Syntax

```bash
sudo ip addr add IP_address/subnet_mask dev interface_name
```

  - Example

```bash
    sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
```

  - This assigns `192.168.1.100` with a `/24` subnet mask to the `eth0` interface
- `ip addr show` (Verify IPv4 Address Assignment)
  - Purpose
    - Display the current configuration of all network interfaces, including assigned IP addresses

  - Syntax

```bash
ip addr show
```

  - Shows all interfaces with their current IP addresses
  - To check a specific interface

```bash
ip addr show dev interface_name
```

  - `interface_name`
    - Name of the interface to check
  - Example  
    ```bash
    ip addr show dev eth0
    ```
  - This shows the IP configuration for `eth0` only
