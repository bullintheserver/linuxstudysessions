## 4.3
Where Data is Stored  
Weight: 3  

### Lesson 1
- Linux Treats Everything as a File
    - Allows for tweaking of all aspects of the system
    - e.g
        - Programs
        - Regular files
        - Directories
        - Block devices (e.g., hard disks)
        - Character devices (e.g., consoles)
        - Kernel processes
        - Sockets
        - Partitions
        - Links
- Linux Directory Structure
    - Begins from the root `/`
- [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/fhs.shtml)
    - Establishes locations for storing important data
    - Locations include
        - Real directories (persistent data on disks)
        - Virtual directories (loaded in memory)
            - Grant access to kernel subsystem data (e.g., running processes, memory use, hardware configuration)
            - Used by commands to monitor and manage system data
- Important Data on a Linux System
    - Programs
        - Executable files containing instructions for the processor
        - Can be
            - Binary files
            - Text files (called scripts)
    - Configuration files
        - Control the operation of a program
        - Traditionally stored as text files
        - Various styles of representing configuration data exist

#### Where Binary Files are Stored
- Binary (Executable) Files
  - Stored in directories within the Linux directory structure
  - These directories all branch from the root directory (`/`)

##### Three-Tier Structure
- First Tier (`/`)
    - Location
        - Root directory (`/`)
   - Purpose
        - Contains essential programs
    - Access
        - Necessary for basic system functions
        - Particularly in *single-user mode*
            - Only the root user has access
            - Typically for maintenance or recovery tasks

- Second Tier (`/usr`)
    - Location
        - `/usr` directory
    - Purpose
        - Stores most of the systemâ€™s multi-user programs
    - Access
        - Used during normal multi-user operations
            - System is functioning with multiple users logged in

- Third Tier (`/usr/local`)
    - Location
        - `/usr/local` directory
    - Purpose
        - Houses software that is not provided by the distribution and has been compiled or installed locally by the user
    - Access
        - Typically contains custom or user-compiled software, providing a space for applications not managed by the system's package manager

##### Key Points
- Each tier has a specific purpose based on the level of access and functionality needed
- The first tier ensures critical programs are available even in limited or recovery modes
- The second tier supports the typical operations of a multi-user system
- The third tier allows for flexibility and customization by the user, separating system-provided software from user-installed software

##### Typical locations

|Location|Contents|Examples|
|--------|--------|--------|
| `/sbin` | Essential binaries for system administration | `parted`, `ip` |
| `/bin` | Essential binaries for all users | `ls`, `mv`, `mkdir` |
| `/usr/sbin` | Binaries for system administration | `deluser`, `groupadd` |
| `/usr/bin` | Most executable files used by all users  | `free`, `pstree`, `sudo`, `man` |
| `/usr/local/sbin` | Locally installed programs for sys admin not managed by the package manager | N/A |
| `/usr/local/bin` | Locally installed programs for regular users | N/A |
| `/opt` | Optional third-party applications | N/A |
| `/home/$USER/bin` | User-specific programs | User-created scripts or binaries |
| `/home/$USER/.local/bin` | User-specific programs, often installed via pip or other user-level package managers | User-installed binaries or scripts |


- Symbolic links
    - Some distros replace `/bin` and `/sbin` with symbolic links redirecting to `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`
- Information gathering
    - `echo $PATH`
        - Displays current search path for executable files in the terminal
        - Displays all directories where system looks for executable programs
        - `$PATH` variable contains colon-separated list of directories
            - Shell searches list when you type a command
    - `which`
        - Locates the full path of an executable file for a given command.
        - It searches through the directories listed in the $PATH variable
        - Returns the first matching executable's path

#### Where Configuration Files are Stored
- `/etc` 
    - Originally a catch-all for misc files
    - Now main folder for configuration files/programs
        - Config files usually
            - Local
            - Plain text (opposed to binary)
            - Control operation of a program
- Naming conventions found in `/etc`
    - Naming convention patterns help identify purpose or association of files within the system
    - `.conf` for general configuration files
        - `resolv.conf`
            - For DNS resolver configuration
        - `sysctl.conf`
            - For kernel parameters 
            - Allows kernel mods without recompiling 
    - *ad hoc* for temporary or no file extension 
        - `group`
            - System group database
        - `hostname`
            - Name of the host computer
        - `hosts`
            - List of IP addresses and their hostname translations
        - `profile`
            - System wide configuration file for Bash
        - `shadow`
            - Encrypted file for user passwords
        - `passwd`

                - Password placeholder (`x` or `*`)
                - User ID (UID)
                - Group ID (GID)
                - GECOS
                    - User real world information
                - Home directory 
                - Login shell
                    - Can be changed with `chsh`
    - `.*+rc` for run commands
        - Used to initialize settings or customize programs and shell behavior 
        - Help automate repetitive tasks
        - Ensure consistent environment 
        - Usually shell scripts or plain text defining
            - Environment variables
            - Aliases
            - Functions
            - etc.

        - Security
            - Reduces risk of errors in critical config files
        - Flexibility
            - Enables selective overrides or additions to default configs by simply adding new files to `.d` directory
            - Allows for different applications to house separate config files for same service
- `HOME` configuration dotfiles
    - Hidden configuration files in user home directory 
    - Files beginning with `.` are considered hidden
        - Referred to as dotfiles

        - Directory containing SSH-related files such as keys, known hosts, configs for sessions

#### The Linux Kernel and Process Management 
- Kernel initialization
    - The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system
        - Must be loaded into a protected area of memory before any processes can run
        - Typically done during the boot process
- Process initialization
    - After the kernel is loaded
    - First process to start has Process ID (PID) 1
    - Today, most commonly systemd
        - Serves as the system and service manager in many Linux distros
- Process chain
    - systemd (or the PID 1 process)
        - Begins the process of launching and managing other processes
    - Each process may start one or more child processes
        - Creates hierarchical structure of running processes on the system
- Kernel's role
    - Once processes are running, the Linux kernel manages system resources for them, including:
        - Hardware resources
        - Memory management (RAM allocation)
        - File and disk access
        - Networking and I/O operations
- Historical context
    - Previously, Linux systems used /sbin/init as the first process
        - Part of the System V Init system manager
    - /sbin/init may still exist on many systems for compatibility purposes
- `/boot`
    - Kernel resides in `/boot` with other boot-related files
    - Names include version components 
        - Kernel version
        - Major revision
        - Minor revision
        - Patch number
    - `config-4.9.0-9-amd64`
        - Configuration settings 
            - Options and modules
                - Compiled along with kernel
    - `initrd.img-e.9.0-9-amd64`
        - Initial RAM disk image 
            - Helps startup processes
            - Loads temp root filesystem into memory
    - `System-map-4.9.0-9-amd64`
        - Also `System-map` or `System.map`
        - Contains memory address location for kernel symbol names
        - Each time kernel rebuilds, file's contents will change as memory locations could be different
        - Kernel uses this file to lookup memory address locations for particular kernel symbols
    - `vmlinuz-4.9.0-9-amd64`
        - The kernel in a self-extracting, space-saving, compressed format
    - `efi`
        - Contains files required for system's UEFI firmware to boot OS
        - Inside you will find bootloaders and other necessary files for booting 
        - Common bootloaders include 
            - GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)
            - shim (used for secure boot)
    - `GRUB`
        - GNU Grand Unified Bootloader
        - Loads and transfers control to OS's kernel during boot process 
        - Allows user to choose OS or kernel to boot into
        - Supports additional features
            - Recovery mode
            - Kernel parameters
            - Command line access 
- `/proc`
    - Virtual filesystem providing a window into the kernel and running processes
    - Does not contain data stored on disk
    - Represents real-time system information
        - Generates dynamically to reflect system state
    - Each container in /proc generates data on system or processes
    - `/proc/cmdline`
        - Stores strings passed to kernel on boot
    - `/proc/modules`
        - Shows list of modules loaded into kernel
    - `/proc/sys`
        - Kernel configuration settings categorized into subdirectories based on functionality
            - Categories incl:
                - `net`: Networking parameters
                - `vm`: Virtual memory management settings
                - `fs`: File system related settings
                - `kernel`: General kernel parameters
        - Contains files that can be read of modified to dynamically change system behavior
            - Influence various aspects of system performance, security, and networking without reboot
        - Changes made directly to `/proc/sys` are not persistent
            - Save in system configuration file for persistence
- `/dev`
    - Contains special files that represent device nodes
    - Provide interface to interact with:
        - Hardware
        - Virtual devices
    - Each file in `/dev` corresponds to device driver that controls access to particular hardware component
    - Types of devices (viewed with `ls -l`)
        - `c` (character devices)
            - Handle data one byte at a time
            - Keyboards, serial ports, mice, etc.
            - e.g. `/dev/tty` (terminal devices)
        - `b` (block devices)
            - Handle data in blocks
            - Hard drives, other storage
            - e.g. `/dev/sda` (hard drive)
    - `udev`
        - Device manager for Linux kernel
        - Handles creation, modification, removal 
        - Automatic detection of devices
        - Hotplugging support
            - System dynamically adjusts to +/- devices
    - Devices files are created and managed by kernel
        - Use specific permissions to control access
    - Common devices in `/dev`
        - `/dev/null`
            - Device that discards all data written to it
        - `/dev/zero`
            - Device that returns endless stream of 0 bytes
        - `/dev/random/` and `/dev/urandom`
            - Sources of random or -pseudo-random data
        - `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb`
            - Represent 1st and 2nd HDs, respectively
    - `/sys`
        - Virtual filesystem
        - Provides real-time access to kernel objects and device attributes
        - The *sys filesystem* (`sysfs`) is mounted on `/sys`
        - `sysfs` exports info about kernel objects (devices, buses, drivers) and their relationships
            - Allows users to query and modify hardware parameters 
#### Memory and Memory Types
- For a program to start running, it must first be loaded into memory
- Random Access Memory (RAM)
    - Primary memory used to store data for running programs
        Advantage
            Speed: RAM is much faster compared to mechanical hard drives
        Disadvantage
            Volatility: RAM is volatile, meaning all data is lost when the system is powered off
    - Referred to as physical memory
        - Are actual hardware chips on the computer
        - Made up of integrated circuits (ICs)
            - Contain millions of transistors and capacitors
        - These circuits form memory cells
            - Each has unique hexadecimal address that can be referenced by programs
- Swap Space (Virtual Memory)
    - Swap is the portion of virtual memory that resides on the hard disk
    - Used when physical RAM is full
        - Allows system to continue functioning by temporarily moving data from RAM to the disk
    - Trade-off
        - Swap is slower but it prevents system crashes
- Virtual Memory
    - An abstraction that combines RAM and swap space, giving the system a larger addressable memory pool for better efficiency
- Information gathering
    - `free` parses `/proc/meminfo/` (`-h` for human readable, `-b` for bytes, etc.)
        - `total`
            - Total amount of physical and swap memory installed
        - `used`
            - Amount of physical and swap memory in use
        - `free`
            - Amount of physical and swap memory not in use
        - `shared`
            - Amount of physical memory used -mostly- by `tmpfs`
        - `buff/cache`
            - Amount of physical memory currently in use by kernel buffers and the page cache and slabs
        - `available`
            - Estimate of how much physical memory is available for new processes
