## 4.3
Where Data is Stored  
Weight: 3  

### Lesson 1
- Linux Treats Everything as a File
    - Allows for tweaking of all aspects of the system
    - e.g
        - Programs
        - Regular files
        - Directories
        - Block devices (e.g., hard disks)
        - Character devices (e.g., consoles)
        - Kernel processes
        - Sockets
        - Partitions
        - Links
- Linux Directory Structure
    - Begins from the root `/`
- Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
    - Establishes locations for storing important data
    - Locations include
        - Real directories (persistent data on disks)
        - Virtual directories (loaded in memory)
            - Grant access to kernel subsystem data (e.g., running processes, memory use, hardware configuration)
            - Used by commands to monitor and manage system data
- Important Data on a Linux System
    - Programs
        - Executable files containing instructions for the processor
        - Can be
            - Binary files
            - Text files (called scripts)
    - Configuration files
        - Control the operation of a program
        - Traditionally stored as text files
        - Various styles of representing configuration data exist

#### Where Binary Files are Stored
- Binary (Executable) Files
  - Stored in directories within the Linux directory structure
  - These directories all branch from the root directory (`/`)

##### Three-Tier Structure
- First Tier (`/`)
    - Location
        - Root directory (`/`)
   - Purpose
        - Contains essential programs
    - Access
        - Necessary for basic system functions
        - Particularly in *single-user mode*
            - Only the root user has access
            - Typically for maintenance or recovery tasks

- Second Tier (`/usr`)
    - Location
        - `/usr` directory
    - Purpose
        - Stores most of the systemâ€™s multi-user programs
    - Access
        - Used during normal multi-user operations
            - System is functioning with multiple users logged in

- Third Tier (`/usr/local`)
    - Location
        - `/usr/local` directory
    - Purpose
        - Houses software that is not provided by the distribution and has been compiled or installed locally by the user
    - Access
        - Typically contains custom or user-compiled software, providing a space for applications not managed by the system's package manager

##### Key Points
- Each tier has a specific purpose based on the level of access and functionality needed
- The first tier ensures critical programs are available even in limited or recovery modes
- The second tier supports the typical operations of a multi-user system
- The third tier allows for flexibility and customization by the user, separating system-provided software from user-installed software

##### Typical locations

|Location|Contents|Examples|
|--------|--------|--------|
| `/sbin` | Essential binaries for system administration | `parted`, `ip` |
| `/bin` | Essential binaries for all users | `ls`, `mv`, `mkdir` |
| `/usr/sbin` | Binaries for system administration | `deluser`, `groupadd` |
| `/usr/bin` | Most executable files used by all users  | `free`, `pstree`, `sudo`, `man` |
| `/usr/local/sbin` | Locally installed programs for sys admin not managed by the package manager | N/A |
| `/usr/local/bin` | Locally installed programs for regular users | N/A |
| `/opt` | Optional third-party applications | N/A |
| `/home/$USER/bin` | User-specific programs | User-created scripts or binaries |
| `/home/$USER/.local/bin` | User-specific programs, often installed via pip or other user-level package managers | User-installed binaries or scripts |


- Symbolic links
    - Some distros replace `/bin` and `/sbin` with symbolic links redirecting to `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`
